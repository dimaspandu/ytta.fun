# Session App

The Session App focuses on the creation and participation in sessions.  
A session represents a temporary group-buying or ordering opportunity, such as colleagues pooling together for snacks or coffee. Orders are tied to these sessions until the session is closed.  

### Team Scope
- Allow users to create and manage sessions.
- Enable participants to join sessions and place orders.
- Provide interfaces for closing sessions and handling outcomes.
